# Ray Tracer - Computer Graphics Assignment 1

## 🎯 Objective  
This assignment implements a **basic ray tracer** that renders a scene with:  
- A **plane** at `y = -2`  
- **Three spheres** at:  
  - (-4, 0, -7) with radius 1  
  - (0, 0, -7) with radius 2  
  - (4, 0, -7) with radius 1  
- Uses **Phong shading** for basic lighting.  
- Displays results using **OpenGL & GLFW**.
- The image resolution is 512×512 pixels.
- Camera is at (0,0,0) looking along -z.
- Implemented using ray-sphere & ray-plane intersection.

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Ray Intersection** for spheres and plane  
✔ **Perspective Camera** setup  
✔ **Phong Illumination Model** for shading  
✔ **Rendering using OpenGL**  

---

## 🛠 Installation & Compilation  

### **🔹 Prerequisites**  
✅ **Visual Studio 2022**  
✅ **C++ Compiler with OpenGL Support**  
✅ **Git** (optional for version control)  

> 🚀 **No need to install OpenGL, GLFW, or GLM manually** since they are already included in the project folder!
